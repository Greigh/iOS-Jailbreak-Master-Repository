### What do I do with this list?
Currently you can copy and paste the list to add it to your favorite package manager.

### Glossary
* Utility Repos - Jailbreak utility (unc0ver, checkra1n, Chimera, etc) repos that are added automatically
* Retired Repos - Repos that are still active but are either archived, or aren't being updated.
* Removed Repos - These are repos that don't exist anymore so they have been removed from the list.
* Package Manager Repos - Repos that you can added to add a new package manager
* Beta Repos - Repos that hold beta builds of jailbreak tweaks, themes, and applications
* tvOS Repos - These are repos that you can use with a tvOS jailbreak for the Apple TV
* DEB Files - These are not repos but rather just DEB files that you can install a specific tweak, theme, or application with
* General Repos - This is the main list of repositories that are found around the jailbreak community

### Any kind of piracy will not be allowed in the database.
* Please submit an issue if you notice any of these repos having any kind of piracy related activities.

### This list will be updated consistently.
* Please let me know if any of these repos retire or need removed by submitting an issue here.
* If you notice that a repo has been removed (404 error) in your package manager, let me know by submitting an issue or contacting me and I'll get the list updated

### Recommended Package Managers 
* Zebra - https://getzbra.com/repo/
* Installer - https://apptapp.me/repo/
* Sileo (only for Electra, Chimera12, and Chimera1n) - https://repo.getsileo.app/
* Cydia is NOT recommended because it is slow and outdated

### Future plans
* Creating a DEB to install that will update your sources automatically with any changes that happen! I am busy in my personal life so this may take awhile. So be patient!
* Any other ideas, please contact me! I love feedback!
