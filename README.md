### Any kind of piracy will not be allowed in the database.
* Please submit an issue if you notice any of these repos having any kind of piracy related activities.

### This list will be updated consistently.
* Please let me know if any of these repos retire or need removed by submitting an issue here.

### Recommended Package Managers 
* Zebra - https://getzbra.com/repo/
* Installer - https://apptapp.me/repo/
* Cydia is NOT recommended because it is slow and outdated
* Sileo is ONLY recommended on Chimera/Electra at this time

### Future plans
* Creating a DEB to install that will update your sources automatically with any changes that happen! I am busy in my personal life so this may take awhile. So be patient!
